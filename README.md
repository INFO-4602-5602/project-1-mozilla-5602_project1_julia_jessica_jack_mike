Design process:
- brain storming
	- viz ideas
		- we'll each sketch/prototype several vizes
		- in categories, simple, medium, ambitious 
	-	possible central insights we'd like to focus on or explore more
		- possibilities
			- comfort levels, specific concerns, maybe correlating self proclaimed comfort levels with what type of tech their buying? 
- logisitics
	- maybe we need to throw out or deal with incomplete survey responses? 
	
- Development
	- we'll work in google drive for most of our communications and updates
	- github for code 
	- We'll use Bokeh and python :)
